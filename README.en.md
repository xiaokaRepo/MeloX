## Screenshots

### MeloX Desktop (macOS)

MeloX Desktop uses a Mac-native sidebar, multi-column content area, and persistent bottom player. Its wider layout keeps browsing, lyrics, and the play queue close at hand. The immersive player combines artwork, word-synced lyrics, playback controls, and volume, and can switch between lyrics and queue sidebars. Synced lyrics can also remain visible beside the Home page.

The desktop app also provides an autoplay queue, playlist details designed for horizontal space, and direct access to messages, Music Cloud Drive, downloads, and settings. The website provides Developer ID-signed and Apple-notarized DMGs for Apple silicon and Intel. GitHub Releases provide separate unsigned CI builds for both architectures. See the [MeloX website](https://melox.luoxe.cn/) for details and downloads.

### Featured: Text PV Lyrics

The templates, visual effects, and original implementation of Text PV come from [PV Tool](https://github.com/DanteAlighieri13210914/pv-tool) by DanteAlighieri13210914 (Copyright © 2026 DanteAlighieri13210914).

MeloX ports this work to native SwiftUI and renders it in real time from lyric playback progress. It currently includes 18 styles, configurable effect intensity and animation speed, and full-screen player support.

> **License notice:** Text PV templates, effects, and related derivative content are separately governed by the PV Tool [Non-Commercial License](MeloX/Resources/PVTool-LICENSE.txt) and may only be used for non-commercial purposes. The MeloX GPLv3 license does not supersede that license. Commercial products, paid services, and commercial integrations require separate permission from the original author. See the [commercial licensing notice](MeloX/Resources/PVTool-COMMERCIAL.md).

### Apple Watch (In Development)

The watch app currently supports independent sign-in, search, daily recommendations, playlist browsing, local playback, and synchronized lyrics. The player uses horizontal paging.

> The watch app remains under active development. Its feature scope, interface, and minimum system requirements may change.

## Smart AutoMix

Smart AutoMix uses a Core ML conversion of the general-purpose [BeatNet](https://github.com/mjhydri/BeatNet) model by Mojtaba Heydari to analyze beats, downbeats, tempo, and opening energy on device.

MeloX uses a fixed 32-second window and an FP16 Core ML ML Program. MeloX performs feature extraction and temporal decoding on device. The model is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). See the [BeatNet model notice](MeloX/Resources/Models/BeatNet/BeatNet-NOTICE.md) for conversion and attribution details.

## Requirements

- Xcode 26.6 or later
- iOS / iPadOS 26.0 or later
- macOS 15.0 or later
- watchOS 10.0 or later (the watch app remains under development)
- Swift 5
- An Apple Developer account capable of code signing when running on physical devices

## Local Build

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youshen2/MeloX.git MeloX
   cd MeloX
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

## Known Limitations

- NetEase Cloud Music does not publicly guarantee long-term API stability. Server changes may break individual features.
- Preview access, full playback, quality levels, and regional availability depend on the NetEase Cloud Music account, licensing, and server policy.
- MeloX is not intended to bypass payment, copyright, or regional restrictions.
- The Apple Watch version remains under development and does not yet guarantee complete features or data compatibility.
- macOS DMGs on GitHub Releases are unsigned CI builds. Download Developer ID-signed and Apple-notarized builds from the website.
